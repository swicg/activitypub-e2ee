    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This specification documents the use of Messaging Layer
    Security (MLS) over the ActivityPub API and federation
    protocol. MLS is a protocol for end-to-end encryption of group
    messaging. ActivityPub is a federated social networking
    protocol. This specification describes how to use ActivityPub
    as a transport layer for MLS encrypted conversations.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Messaging Layer Security (MLS) [[rfc9420]] is an end-to-end
    encrypted messaging framework. It is designed to work with
    different lower-level protocols which provide necessary
    services for transporting data around the network.</p>
    <p>[[ActivityPub]] is the W3C social networking standard. It
    defines an API for client to server interactions and a
    federation protocol for server to server communications.
    ActivityPub's native data format is Activity Streams 2.0 (AS2)
    [[activitystreams-core]], an extensible [[JSON-LD]] vocabulary
    for common social network objects and activities.</p>
    <p>This document describes the interfaces between MLS and
    ActivityPub. In particular, it explains how ActivityPub can
    provide the Delivery Service and Authentication Service
    features of MLS, as described in the MLS Architecture
    [[rfc9750]]. It provides an extension to the AS2 Activity
    Vocabulary for supporting these features.</p>
    <p>The data structure of this specification follows a
    three-layer model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ActivityPub as an envelope data structure, to ensure data
      routing, persistence, and federation across servers. The JSON
      envelopes are conveyed directly across the ActivityPub
      network.</li>
      <li>MLS as an encryption and signature layer, as well as a
      group management layer. MLS messages carry information such
      as the formation of a group, adding and removing members of a
      group, and changes to the shared encryption keys for the
      group. The MLS message objects are embedded as base64-encoded
      binary objects within the ActivityPub JSON envelopes.</li>
      <li>A limited profile of Activity Streams 2.0 for
      representing messages and conversations (see <a>application
      data</a>). The embedded AS2 content objects are intentionally
      not compliant with ActivityPub rules for objects -- in
      particular, because object IDs in this profile are not HTTPS
      URLs, nor even dereferenceable URIs. ActivityPub servers do
      not manage these objects, and are in fact unaware of their
      contents or interrelationships -- which is the point of
      end-to-end encryption, after all. These AS2 objects are
      embedded in the <code>application_data</code> fields of MLS
      PrivateMessage objects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This document is not an implementation manual for MLS over
    ActivityPub. Instead, it attempts to provide a minimal
    interaction layer between the two frameworks. Implementers
    should be familiar with both MLS and ActivityPub.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="delivery-service">
    <h2>Delivery Service</h2>
    <p>The Delivery Service role in MLS has two main
    responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>delivery of messages to the group ("Group channel")</li>
      <li>maintaining a key store ("directory")</li>
    </ul>
    <section id="message-delivery">
      <h3>Message delivery</h3>
      <p>ActivityPub provides a robust delivery mechanism for AS2
      objects. To send an object to others on the network, a user
      POSTs a <code>Create</code> activity to their own
      <code>outbox</code> property with the addresses of the
      recipients in the <code>to</code> or <code>cc</code>
      properties. The sending actor's server adds an
      <code>id</code> property to the activity and the object and
      stores the object before forwarding it to the recipients
      across the federation protocol.</p>
      <aside class="example" title=
      "An object as sent from server to server">

      <p>MLS data is structured in a binary format and includes
      detailed encryption and signature fields. For this reason,
      the MLS wire formats are preserved in AS2 objects with
      <code>mediaType</code> set to <code>message/mls</code>.</p>
      <p>Each of the <a href=
      "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html#name-mls-wire-formats">
      five MLS wire format</a> structures has an equivalent data
      type defined as an AS2 extension in the MLS context:
      <a>PublicMessage</a>, <a>PrivateMessage</a>, <a>Welcome</a>,
      <a>GroupInfo</a>, and <a>KeyPackage</a>.</p>

      <p>Because managing group membership is an essential part of
      the MLS protocol, delivery of MLS objects over the
      ActivityPub network requires addressing all recipients
      explicitly. Only actors can be recipients. Clients must not
      address MLS messages to collections, such as to the actor's
      <code>followers</code> collection or to the
      <code>as:Public</code> collection. See <a href=
      "#privacy-considerations">Privacy considerations</a> for more
      details.</p>
      <p>Reading incoming messages is done through the actor's
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox">inbox</a>
      property. This is a collection of all activities received by
      the actor,including but not exclusive to activities related
      to MLS. ActivityPub does not support push notifications, so
      MLS-enabled ActivityPub clients have to periodically poll the
      inbox collection for new activities.</p>
      <p>Other activities in the object lifecycle, such as
      reactions, updates, or deletions, should be handled as part
      of the <a>application data</a> within MLS private messages,
      and not as regular ActivityPub activities. So, for example,
      creating and updating an encrypted <code>Note</code> is
      modeled as two <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create">
      Create</a> activities -- one for the creation, the second for
      the update.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="key-storage">
      <h3>Key storage</h3>
      <p>Each actor in the ActivityPub network has a public profile
      with important protocol properties defined, such as <a href=

      <p>The set of currently valid <a>KeyPackage</a> objects for
      an actor are an additional property of the actor object,
      <a>keyPackages</a>. Its value is an ActivityPub <a href=

    <h2>Authentication Service</h2>
    <p>The Authentication Service in the MLS framework has the

    an identity is expressed as an actor object URL.</p>
    <p>In the ActivityPub model shown here, authenticating a

    <ol>
      <li>Retrieving the actor with the given ID; this requires an

  <section id="application-data">
    <h2><dfn class="export">Application data</dfn></h2>
    <p>MLS is agnostic about application data encrypted and sent
    over the network. To match the ActivityPub model, this
    specification defines the application data for use over MLS as
    Activity Streams 2.0 content objects and activities. Unlike
    ActivityPub objects, these AS2 objects are not available for
    download from any server, and do not use HTTPS URLs as
    <code>id</code> values.</p>
    <p>In general, the content of the MLS messages should be
    self-encapsulated and not dependent on external resources.
    Client applications cannot rely on a server to save state for
    the group and the shared application data. This restricts the
    use of URLs and <code>Link</code> objects in the content.</p>
    <section id="content-objects">
      <h3>Content objects</h3>
      <p>The Activity Vocabulary defines several document types for
      content. The following types are used in this
      specification.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-note">
          Note</a> - for short text, about a paragraph or less,
          like a microblogging post or a comment
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-article">
          Article</a> - for longer texts, about the length of a
          magazine article or a blog post
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-image">
          Image</a> - two-dimensional images, like photos or
          diagrams
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-audio">
          Audio</a> - any sound files, like music, a sound effect,
          or a podcast episode
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-video">
          Video</a> - moving images, like a movie, TV show, or
          short
        </li>
      </ul>There are the following restrictions on the properties
      of the content objects:
      <ul>
        <li><code>id</code>. This should be a unique URI, but not
        an HTTPS URL. A UUID, for example, provides a reasonably
        unique value that can be indexed in the client's local
        storage.</li>
        <li><code>mediaType</code>. For <code>Note</code> and
        <code>Article</code>, these should be unset, or use the
        default "text/html". For the other content types, this
        should include the Internet Media Type for the object, such
        as "image/png" or "video/ogg".</li>
        <li><code>encoding</code>. A new property introduced in
        this document; the default value is "base64", for base64
        encoding.</li>
        <li><code>content</code>. For <code>Note</code> and
        <code>Article</code>, this should be the HTML content of
        the object, as usual. For the other types, this should be
        the base64-encoded content of the object itself. For an
        <code>Image</code> in Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
        format, the <code>content</code> property value will be the
        base64-encoded image data.</li>
        <li><code>summary</code>. A summary or description of the
        content.</li>
        <li><code>url</code>. This should be undefined; the object
        should not have a version available as a Web page.</li>
        <li><code>attachment</code>. These values should not be
        <code>Link</code> objects; instead, they should be content
        objects of the above types. They should be included fully

        <code>shares</code>. In this application of MLS, reactions
        to content objects are not tracked by a server, but by each
        client individually. Consequently, these values should be
        unset.</li>
        <li><code>attributedTo</code>. This can be derived from the
        properties of the ActivityPub envelope and are not
        required. If provided, it should be ignored.</li>

        properties. These can be derived from the properties of the
        ActivityPub envelope and are not required.</li>
        <li><code>tag</code>. <code>Mention</code> and
        <code>Hashtag</code> object ids can be used to identify
        topics or mentioned actors.</li>

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>Activities are the top-level content in MLS messages.</p>
      <p>The following Activity types from the Activity Vocabulary
      are defined in this document.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>Create</code> Introduces a new object. The value of
          the <code>object</code> property should be a <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#node-objects">node
          object</a> -- all properties represented as a JSON
          object. The <code>id</code> of the object must be unique.
        </li>
        <li><code>Update</code> Updates the properties of an
        existing object.Only changed properties must be included in
        the <code>object</code> property. The <code>id</code>
        property must match an object that was received as the
        <code>object</code> of a <code>Create</code> property
        previously. Only the sender of the <code>Create</code>
        activity can send an <code>Update</code> for the same
        object.</li>
        <li><code>Delete</code> Deletes an existing object. The
        <code>object</code> property can be a node object or a
        reference. The <code>id</code> property must match an
        object that was received as the <code>object</code> of a
        <code>Create</code> property previously. Only the sender of
        the <code>Create</code> activity can send an
        <code>Delete</code> for the same object.</li>
        <li><code>Like</code> Indicates that the sender likes the
        <code>object</code>. The <code>object</code> property can
        be a node object or a reference. The <code>id</code>
        property must match an object that was received as the
        <code>object</code> of a <code>Create</code> property
        previously.</li>
        <li><code>Announce</code> Shares the <code>object</code>
        with the group. The <code>object</code> property can be a
        node object or a reference. The <code>id</code> property
        can match an object that was received as the
        <code>object</code> of a <code>Create</code> property
        previously; alternately, it can be an ActivityPub object
        with an HTTPS URL <code>id</code>. The latter case allows
        sharing public content into a private chat for discussion,
        possibly with a comment.</li>
        <li><code>Undo</code> Undoes the activity that is the
        <code>object</code>. The <code>object</code> property can
        be a node object or a reference. The <code>id</code>
        property must match an activity that was received
        previously. Only the sender of the previous activity can
        undo it. Undoing a <code>Like</code> activity shows that
        the sender does not like the object. The results of undoing
        other activity types are undefined.</li>
        <li><code>Read</code>. Indicates that the sender has read a
        <code>Note</code> or <code>Article</code>, or the
        description of an <code>Image</code> or other binary file
        type. The <code>object</code> property should be a partial
        embedding or a reference. The <code>id</code> property must
        match an object that was received as the
        <code>object</code> of a <code>Create</code> property
        previously. (<code>Read</code> is an activity type from the
        Activity Vocabulary that is not described in detail in the
        ActivityPub specification.)</li>
        <li><code>Listen</code>. Indicates that the sender has
        listened to an <code>Audio</code> object. The
        <code>object</code> property should be a partial embedding
        or a reference. The <code>id</code> property must match an
        object that was received as the <code>object</code> of a
        <code>Create</code> property previously.
        (<code>Listen</code> is an activity type from the Activity
        Vocabulary that is not described in detail in the
        ActivityPub specification.)</li>
        <li><code>View</code>. Indicates that the sender has viewed
        an <code>Image</code> object or <code>Video</code> object.
        The <code>object</code> property should be a partial
        embedding or a reference. The <code>id</code> property must
        match an object that was received as the
        <code>object</code> of a <code>Create</code> property
        previously. (<code>View</code> is an activity type from the
        Activity Vocabulary that is not described in detail in the
        ActivityPub specification.)</li>
        <li>
          <code>IntransitiveActivity</code>. This is a base
          activity type defined in the Activity Vocabulary. For
          this specification, an <code>IntransitiveActivity</code>
          object can be sent as a null message, which can obscure
          messaging patterns (see <a href=
          "#metadata-leakage">Metadata leakage</a>). Recipients
          should ignore and discard the activity.
          (<code>IntransitiveActivity</code> is an activity type
          from the Activity Vocabulary that is not described in
          detail in the ActivityPub specification.)

    <h2>Security considerations</h2>
    <p>These are notable security considerations with this
    specification.</p>
    <section id="html-sanitization">
      <h3>HTML Sanitization</h3>
      <p>Many of the <a href="#content-objects">content types</a>
      included in the application data for this specification use
      HTML either for the <code>summary</code> or
      <code>content</code> properties. Attackers can use features
      of HTML5, like JavaScript and CSS, to cause problems in the
      users' browsers. One mitigation is to sanitize the HTML,
      removing elements and attributes that can be problematic for
      users.</p>
      <p>In ActivityPub, many servers will sanitize HTML for
      content as it arrives at the server, so that clients can use
      the content without security concerns. Because the encrypted
      application data in this specification is not visible to the
      ActivityPub server, it is up to the client application to
      sanitize the HTML.</p>

    <section id="key-substitution">
      <h3>Key Substitution</h3>
      <p>The <a>keyPackages</a> collection used in this document
      for sharing and confirming cryptographic keys is easy to
      implement and use. However, because the collection is managed
      by the actor's server, the collection is subject to a key
      substitution attack. A malicious server can add one of its
      own keys to the collection, or replace one of the keys with
      its own. Sophisticated attackers would present different
      <code>keyPackages</code> collection contents to different
      clients.</p>
      <p>One mitigation for this attack is key-fingerprint
      verification, in which participants in a group compare the
      fingerprints they see for keys for an identity.</p>

    <section id="private-key-storage">
      <h3>Private key storage</h3>
      <p>The private keys created by clients and used for
      encryption and signatures in the MLS framework are crucial to
      the security of the system. Compromise of the key through
      physical or remote access to the device could expose
      encrypted data in the server-stored messages. To mitigate
      this risk, client applications should make use of platform
      services for secure key storage where available. If keys must
      be stored on disk, they should be encrypted with a password
      under the user's control.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="plaintext-storage">
      <h3>Plaintext storage</h3>
      <p>Rebuilding group state and decrypted message content from
      server-stored MLS message data in the <code>inbox</code> can
      be time-consuming. Therefore, many clients will persist that
      state and decrypted content on the client side. But physical
      or remote access to the client device could expose that
      decrypted content to an attacker.</p>
      <p>One mitigation for this risk is to store decrypted content
      locally in an encrypted file or drive volume, with the
      encryption key stored in the platform's secure storage, or
      with a password under the user's control.</p>

    <h2>Privacy considerations</h2>
    <section id="metadata-leakage">
      <h3>Metadata leakage</h3>
      <p>The binary MLS objects used in this specification have
      strong encryption to protect the contents from servers. The
      ActivityPub envelopes used for their delivery, however, can
      be inspected by servers along the delivery path -- the
      sending actor's server and the receiving actors' servers.</p>
      <p>There is metadata in the envelopes that can be used by an
      observer to draw conclusions about the conversations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sender and recipients</strong>. These
        addressing properties are necessary for the delivery of
        ActivityPub objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Timestamps</strong>. Timestamps are added by
        the sender's server and forwarded to other servers. They
        can be used to analyse patterns in the conversation. One
        mitigation is to add random dummy messages with the
        <code>IntransitiveActivity</code> activity type (see
        above), which can obscure the real patterns in
        conversations.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Message size</strong>. The size of the
          <code>PrivateMessage</code> objects can give a signal for
          what the contents of the message are. For example, a
          <code>Like</code> activity which uses the object's ID URI
          as a property value would be smaller than a
          <code>Create</code> activity with an embedded node object
          as the <code>object</code> property value. MLS provides

          padding</a> feature to mitigate this problem.
